Remake of a [game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPUBQt0OBDY) I made in 2014. The goal of the game is to destroy your opponent by building ships in real-time (loosely inspired by the [Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life))

The original game was in flash, so a nim rewrite is more in the modern era. I would like it to run in browsers, so a [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) compatibility is desired. (hence the choice to use GLFW & OpenGL instead of a higher-level library).

The rewrite is still in its first steps
